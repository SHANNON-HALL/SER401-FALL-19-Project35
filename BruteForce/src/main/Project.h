 * Description:
 * Student to project allocation requires a model of a project in such a manner
 * that allows the system to match up projects to students allocated into a team
 * and partition project populations based on target characteristics. Unique
 * identifiers are captured, such as the ProjectID, and relational attributes are
 * defined, such as the ClassID and Type, that will help keep track of what
 * projects are available to each instance of a student. Each instance of a
 * project represents a project sponsored in real life; prioritized for
 * student allocation.
